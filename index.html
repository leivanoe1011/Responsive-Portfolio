            In summary I'm a Developer.  Over a decade in Development work both in the Operations and Technical support.  
            Not only do I understand the business objectives but I'm able to translate them into applications that meet our business needs.  
            I enjoy turning an idea or business requirement into a distinguished software application.  
            The challenge and thrill of building something new or troubleshooting something in production is exciting to me.

            In combination with my extensive experience, I possess the fortitude to complete any challenge in front of me.  
            In fact, graduated from the University of California Riverside with a bachelors in Economics and a Masters in 
            Computer Science specializing in Software Engineering from National University, during which having to work full-time.

            Be that as it may, my greatest attribute is my determination and ability to adapt.  No challenge is too big or impossible for me.  
            I’m able to figure out the issue either on my own or collaborating with my teammates to complete the task on hand.  
            I stay grounded and open to learn from my friends and piers at all times.

            On the other hand, when I’m not on my computer, I love to enjoy life.  Either, I’m working out, playing soccer or I’m out traveling. 

            My biggest drive is to continue working remotely and try to make a difference to those I meet in my adventures around the world. 
            Ultimately, I will like to get to a point in my life to share with those around me my experiences so they can better their lives.  
            Help people to have access to all these opportunities around the world so they can achieve their dreams and aspirations just as I have.
